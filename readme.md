Netflix & Grill is a date night idea generator. This application is for a couple who just can't decide what to do for their date night.

This application allows you to select a type of cuisine, and then select a genre of movies. The app will then generate 3 recipe options (with links to the recipes) alongside 3 movie options (with links to the movie IMDB page). If you want to select new options, just press reset, and you can start again.
